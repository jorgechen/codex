Set up the database:
$ python
>>> from server import db
>>> db.create_all()

Start the server:
$ python server.py

Go to
localhost:5000




NOTES:
Used SQLite because it is convenient and pg would be overkill.

I did not implement this, but an improvement is allowing "\t" key in a <textarea> so it is easier to edit the CSV data.
